                <p>Behind their intimidating barks and serious looks, the German Shepherd is an extremely lovable dog with a big personality. German Shepherd’s love attention and will let you know when they feel like they have not had enough. Likewise, German Shepherd’s love to talk, whether it is a deep bark, a dramatic moan, or a high-pitched yelp, the German Shepherd will find its way to communicate with its owner.</p>

                <p>While it does depend greatly on the dog’s history and temperament, German Shepherd Dogs are extremely friendly dogs that can typically get along with other dogs and cats. However, be sure to properly introduce your dog to new animals to ensure a positive interaction. Just because a dog usually gets along with another dog or cat does not mean that they will be friendly with every dog or cat they meet. Dogs in general have their own language and not every dog will respect a new dog or cat. Be sure to advocate for your German Shepherd and never force them to be in a situation if they are visibly uncomfortable.</p>

                <h3>5 Tips to keep in mind when training:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>German Shepherds are extremely food motivated, always keep their favorite treat on hand</li>
                    <li>Keep training sessions short and sweet (less than 20 minutes)</li>
                    <li>Positive reinforcement will return better and faster results than negative reinforcement</li>
                    <li>Repetition is key. Do not expect your German Shepherd to learn the trick in one session</li>
                    <li>Have fun. Your German Shepherd can sense when you are stressed. If you have fun, then they will too</li>
